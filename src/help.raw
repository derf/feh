Usage : " PACKAGE " [OPTIONS]... FILES...
 Where a FILE is an image file or a directory.
 Multiple files are supported.
 Urls are supported. They must begin with http:// or ftp:// and you must
 have wget installed to download the files for viewing.
 Options can also be specified in the in the feh configuration file. See
 man feh for more details
 -h, --help                display this help and exit
 -v, --version             output version information and exit
 -V, --verbose             output useful information, progress bars, etc
 -q, --quiet               Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads
                           Verbose and quiet modes are not mutually exclusive,
                           the first controls informational messages, the
                           second only errors.
 -T, --theme THEME         Load options from config file with name THEME
                           see man feh for more info.
 -_, --rcfile FILE         Use FILE to parse themes and options from,
                           instead of the default ~/.fehrc, /etc/fehrc files.
 -r, --recursive           Recursively expand any directories in FILE to
                           the content of those directories. (Take it easy)
 -z, --randomize           When viewing multiple files in a slideshow,
                           randomise the file list before displaying
 --no-jump-on-resort       Don't jump to the first image when the filelist
                           is resorted.
 -g, --geometry STRING     Limit (and don't change) the window size. Takes
                           an X-style geometry string like 640x480.
                           Note that larger images will be zoomed out to fit
                           but you can see them at 1:1 by clicking the zoom
                           button.
 -f, --filelist FILE       This option is similar to the playlists used by
                           music software. If FILE exists, it will be read
                           for a list of files to load, in the order they
                           appear. The format is a list of image filenames,
                           absolute or relative to the current directory,
                           one filename per line.
                           If FILE doesn't exist, it will be created from the
                           internal filelist at the end of a viewing session.
                           This is best used to store the results of complex
                           sorts (-Spixels for example) for later viewing.
                           Any changes to the internal filelist (such as
                           deleting a file or it being pruned for being
                           unloadable) will be saved to FILE when feh exits.
                           You can add files to filelists by specifying them
                           on the commandline when also specifying the list.
 -|, --start-at POSITION   Start at POSITION in the filelist
 -p, --preload             Preload images. This doesn't mean hold them in
                           RAM, it means run through and eliminate unloadable
                           images first. Otherwise they will be removed as you
                           flick through.
 -., --scale-down          Automatically scale down images too big for the
                           screen. Currently only works with -P
 -F, --full-screen         Make the window fullscreen
 -Z, --auto-zoom           Zoom picture to screen size in fullscreen mode,
                           is affected by the option --stretch
     --zoom PERCENT        Zooms images by a PERCENT, when in full screen
                           mode or when window geometry is fixed. If combined
                           with --auto-zoom, zooming will be limited to the
                           the size.
 -w, --multiwindow         Disable slideshow mode. With this setting,
                           instead of opening multiple files in slideshow
                           mode, multiple windows will be opened.
 -x, --borderless          Create borderless windows
 -d, --draw-filename       Draw the filename at the top-left of the image.
 -^, --title TITLE         Use TITLE as the window title in slideshow mode.
 -D, --slideshow-delay NUM For slideshow mode, specifies time delay (seconds,
                           can be a decimal) between automatically changing
                           slides.
     --cycle-once          exit feh after one loop through a slideshow
 -R, --reload NUM          Use this option to tell feh to reload an image
                           after NUM seconds. Useful for viewing webcams
                           via http, or even on your local machine.
 -Q, --builtin             Use builtin http grabber to grab remote files
                           instead of wget.
                           mechanism, useful if don't have wget.
 -k, --keep-http           When viewing files using http, feh normally
                           deletes the local copies after viewing, or,
                           if caching, on exit. This option prevents this
                           so that you get to keep the local copies.
                           They will be in the current working directory
                           with \"feh\" in the name.
     --caption-path PATH   Path to directory containing image captions.
                           This turns on caption viewing, and if captions
                           are found in PATH, which is relative to the
                           directory of each image, they are overlayed
                           on the displayed image.
                           e.g with caption path \"captions\", and viewing
                           image images/foo.jpg, caption will be looked for
                           as \"images/captions/foo.jpg.txt\"
 -j, --output-dir          Output directory for saved files.  Really only
                           useful with the -k flag.
 -G, --wget-timestamp      When viewing http images with reload set (eg
                           webcams), try to only reload the image if the
                           remote file has changed.
 -l, --list                Don't display images. Analyse them and display an
                           'ls' style listing. Useful in scripts hunt out
                           images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.
 -L, --customlist FORMAT   Use FORMAT as the format specifier for list
                           output. FORMAT is a printf-like string containing
                           image info specifiers. See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.
 -U, --loadable            Don't display images. Just print out their name
                           if imlib2 can successfully load them.
 -u, --unloadable          Don't display images. Just print out their name
                           if imlib2 can NOT successfully load them.
 -S, --sort SORT_TYPE      The file list may be sorted according to image
                           parameters. Allowed sort types are: name,
                           filename, width, height, pixels, size, format.
                           For sort modes other than name or filename, a
                           preload run will be necessary, causing a delay
                           proportional to the number of images in the list
 -n, --reverse             Reverse the sort order. Use this to invert the order
                           of the filelist. Eg to sort in reverse width order,
                           use -nSwidth
 -A, --action ACTION       Specify a string as an action to perform on the
                           image. In slideshow or multiwindow modes, the action
                           in list mode, or loadable|unloadable modes, the
                           action will be run for each file.
                           The action will be executed by /bin/sh. Use
                           format specifiers to refer to image info. See
                           FORMAT SPECIFIERS for examples
                           Eg. -A \"mv %f ~/images/%%n\"
                           In slideshow mode, the next image will be shown
                           after running the command, in multiwindow mode,
                           the window will be closed.
     --action1 ACTION      These extra action options allow you to specify
     --action2 ACTION      multiple additional actions which can be invoked
     ...                   using the appropriate number key 1-9
     --action9 ACTION
     --draw-actions        Show the defined actions and what they do
 -m, --montage             Enable montage mode. Montage mode creates a new
                           image consisting of a grid of thumbnails of the
                           images specified using FILE... When montage mode
                           is selected, certain other options become
                           available. See MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
 -c, --collage             Same as montage mode, but the thumbnails are
                           distributed randomly. You must specify width and
                           height or supply a background image or both
 -i, --index               Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to
                           montage mode, and accepts the same options. It
                           creates an index print of thumbails, printing the
                           images name beneath each thumbnail. Index mode
                           enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE
                           OPTIONS
 -t, --thumbnails          As --index, but clicking an image will open it in
                           a new viewing window
     --cache-thumbnails    Enable thumbnail caching for thumbnail mode.
                           Only works with thumbnails <= 256x256 pixels
     --thumb-redraw N      Redraw thumbnail window every N images
 -~, --thumb-title STRING  Set window title for images opened from thumbnail mode.
                           Supports format specifiers, see there.
 -I, --fullindex           Same as index mode, but below each thumbnail you
                           get image name, size and dimensions
     --index-name BOOL     Show/Don't show filename in index/thumbnail mode
     --index-size BOOL     Show/Don't show filesize in index/thumbnail mode
     --index-dim BOOL      Show/Don't show dimensions in index/thumbnail mode
     --bg-tile FILE        Set FILE as tiled desktop background. Feh can
                           use enlightenment IPC if you are running it,
                           or will fall back to X methods.
                           Feh stores the commandline necessary to restore
                           the background you chose in ~/.fehbg. So to have
                           feh-set backgrounds restored when you restart X,
                           add the line \"eval `cat $HOME/.fehbg`\" to your
                           X startup script (e.g. ~/.xsession). Note that
                           you only need to do this for non E window
                           managers
     --bg-center FILE      Set FILE as centered desktop background
     --bg-scale FILE       Set FILE as scaled desktop background. This will
                           fill the whole background, but the images' aspect
                           ratio may not be preserved
     --bg-fill FILE        Like --bg-scale, but preserves aspect ratio by
                           zooming the image until it fits
     --bg-seamless FILE    Like --bg-tile, but with blurry corners
 -C, --fontpath PATH       Specify an extra directory to look in for fonts,
                           can be used multiple times to add multiple paths.
 -M, --menu-font FONT      Use FONT for the font in menus.
     --menu-style FILE     Use FILE as the style descriptor for menu text.
 -), --menu-bg BG          Use BG for the background image in menus.
     --menu-border INT     Specify number of pixels that define the menu
                           background's border. Borders are not stretched
                           when images are scaled.
 -B, --image-bg STYLE      Set background for transparent images and the like.
                           Accepted values: white, black, default
 -N, --no-menus            Don't load or show any menus.
 -0, --reload-button B     Use button B to reload the image (defaults to 0)
 -1, --pan-button B        Use button B pan the image (hold button down, move
                           the mouse to move the image around. Advancesto the
                           next image when the mouse is not moved (defaults to
                           1, usually the left button).
 -2, --zoom-button B       Use button B to zoom the current image in any
                           mode (defaults to 2, usually the middle button).
 -3, --menu-button B       Use CTRL+Button B to activate the menu in any
                           mode.  Set to 0 for any button.  This option
                           is disabled if the -N or --no-menus option is set
                           (defaults to 3, usually the right button).
     --menu-ctrl-mask      Require CTRL+Button for menu activation in
                           any mode (default=off).
 -4, --prev-button B       Use button B to switch to the previous image
                           (defaults to 4, which usually is <mousewheel up>).
 -5, --next-button B       Use button B to switch to the next image
                           (defaults to 5, which usually is <mousewheel down>).
 -8, --rotate-button B     Use CTRL+Button B to rotate the current image in
                           any mode (default=2).
     --no-rotate-ctrl-mask Don't require CTRL+Button for rotation in
                           any mode -- just use the button (default=off).
 -9, --blur-button B       Use CTRL+Button B to blur the current image in
                           any mode (default=1).
     --no-blur-ctrl-mask   Don't require CTRL+Button for blurring in
                           any mode -- just use the button (default=off).
     --no-xinerama         Disable Xinerama support.  Only useful if
                           you have Xinerama compiled in.
     --no-screen-clip      Disable window clipping based on screen
                           size.  WARNING: with this option disabled,
                           image windows could become very large, making
                           them unmanageable in certain window managers.
     --hide-pointer        In full screen mode, hide the X mouse pointer.

 MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
 -X, --ignore-aspect       By default, the montage thumbnails will retain
                           their aspect ratios, while fitting in --thumb-width
                           and --thumb-height. This option will force them to
                           be the size set by --thumb-width and --thumb-height
                           This will prevent any whitespace in the final
                           montage
 -s, --stretch             Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified
                           thumbnail size, it will not be enlarged. If this
                           option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit
                           the thumbnail size. (Aspect ratio will be maintained
                           unless --ignore-aspect is specified)
 -y, --thumb-width NUM     Set thumbnail width in pixels
 -E, --thumb-height NUM    Set thumbnail height in pixels
                           Thumbnails default to 20x20 pixels
 -W, --limit-width NUM     Limit the width of the montage in pixels
 -H, --limit-height NUM    Limit the height of the montage in pixels
                           These options can be used together (to define the
                           image size exactly), or separately. If only one is
                           specified, theother is calculated from the number
                           of files specified and the size of the thumbnails.
                           The default is to limit width to 800 pixels and

 1x zoom), and mouse button 3 pans.
 Ctrl+button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur and right to
