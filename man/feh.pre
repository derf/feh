.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
.Nm
is a light-weight, configurable and versatile image viewer.
It is aimed at command line users, but can also be started from graphical file
managers.
Apart from viewing images, it can compile text and thumbnail
listings, show (un)loadable files, set X11 backgrounds, and more.
.
.Pp
.
Features include filelists, various image sorting modes, custom action scripts,
and image captions.
.Nm
can be controlled by configurable keyboard and mouse shortcuts, terminal
input and signals.
When no file arguments or filelists are specified and
.Cm --start-at
is not used,
.Nm
displays all files in the current directory.
.
.Pp
.
EXIF tags are supported either using exiv2 / exifgrep via
.Cm --info
.Pq see the Sx USAGE EXAMPLES No section ,
or as a builtin feature by compiling
.Nm
with exif=1. In this build of
.Nm ,
builtin EXIF support is $MAN_EXIF$.
.
.
.Sh MODES
.
.Nm
is based on various modes, which are selected at startup by command line
options.
.
.Pp
.
Slideshow mode is the default.
It opens a window and displays the first image in it;
the slideshow position can be advanced
.Pq or otherwise changed
using keyboard and mouse shortcuts.
In slideshow mode, images can be deleted either from the filelist or from the
disk, a changed filelist can also be saved to the disk and reopened at a later
time.
An image can also be read from stdin via
.Qq feh - .
.
.Pp
.
Montage mode forms a montage from the filelist.
The resulting image can be viewed or saved,
and its size can be limited by height, width or both.
.
.Pp
.
Index mode forms an index print from the filelist.
Image thumbnails are shown along with the filename,
size and dimensions, printed using a truetype
font of your choice.
The resulting image can be viewed or saved, and its size
can be limited by height, width or both.
.
.Pp
.
Thumbnail mode is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable and open
the selected image in a new window.
.
.Pp
.
Multiwindow mode shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a slideshow
in one window.
Don't use with a large filelist ;)
.
.Pp
.
List mode doesn't display images.
Instead, it outputs an
.Cm ls Ns No - Ns style
listing of the files in the filelist, including image info such as size, number
of pixels, type, etc.
There is also a Customlist mode which prints image info
in a custom format specified by a printf-like format string.
.
.Pp
.
.Nm
can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the
unloadable files.
This is useful for preening a directory.
.
.
.Sh SUPPORTED FORMATS
.
.Nm
can open any format supported by imlib2, most notably jpeg, png,
pnm, tiff, and bmp.
The gif format is also supported, but only for static images.
In case of animations, only the first frame will be shown.
.
If the convert binary
.Pq supplied by ImageMagick
is available, it also has limited support for many other file types, such as
svg, xcf and otf.
If dcraw is available,
.Nm
also supports RAW files provided by cameras and will display the embedded
thumbnails.
Use
.Cm --conversion-timeout Ar timeout
with a non-negative value to enable support for these formats.
.
.Pp
.
As Imlib2 may take several seconds to determine whether it can load a file or
not
.Pq e.g. when attempting to open a large video ,
.Nm
checks each file's header before loading it.
If it looks like an image, it is passed on to Imlib2, otherwise, it is
assumed to be unloadable.
This greatly improves performance when working in directories with mixed files
.Pq i.e., directories which do not exclusively contain image files .
If you think that Imlib2 can load a file which
.Nm
has determined to be likely not an image, set the environment variable
.Qq FEH_SKIP_MAGIC
to pass all files directly to Imlib2, bypassing the header check.
The environment variable's value does not matter, it just needs to be set.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.
.It Cm -A , --action Oo Ar flag Oc Ns Oo [ Ar title ] Oc Ns Ar action
.
Specify a shell command as an action to perform on the image.
In slideshow or multiwindow mode, the action will be run when
the action_0 key is pressed, in list mode, it will be run for each file.
In loadable/unloadable mode, it will be run for each loadable/unloadable
file, respectively.
In thumbnail mode, clicking on an image will cause the action to run instead
of opening the image.
.
.Pp
.
If
.Ar flag
is
.Qq \&; ,
.Nm
will reload the current image instead of switching to the next one
.Pq slideshow mode
or closing the window
.Pq multiwindow mode
after
executing the action.
.
If
.Ar [ title ]
is specified
.Pq note the literal Qo \&[ Qc and Qo ] Qc ,
.Cm --draw-actions
will display
.Ar title
instead of
.Ar action
in the action list.
Note that
.Ar title
must not start with a space.
If it does, the action is handled as if it did not have a title.
This special case exists for backwards compatibility reasons
and makes sure that actions like
.Qq \&[ -L %F \&] && foo
still work.
.
.
.Pp
.
The action will be executed by /bin/sh.
Use format specifiers to refer to image info, see
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS
for details.
Example usage:
.Qq feh -A Qo mv %F ~/images/%N Qc * .
.
.It Cm --action1 No .. Cm --action9 Oo Ar flag Oc Ns Oo [ Ar title ] Oc Ns Ar action
.
Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the appropriate number key.
.
.It Cm --auto-reload
.
.Pq optional feature, $MAN_INOTIFY$ in this build
automatically reload image when the underlying file changes.
Note that auto-reload
.Pq if enabled in the build
is on by default.
This option is only useful to re-enable auto-reload after it has been
disabled by a preceding
.Cm --reload=0
option.
.
.Pp
.
Automatic reload is not supported in montage, index, or thumbnail mode.
.
.It Cm --auto-rotate
.
.Pq optional feature, $MAN_EXIF$ in this build
Automatically rotate images based on EXIF data.
Does not alter the image files.
.
.It Cm -Z , --auto-zoom
.
Zoom pictures to screen size in fullscreen / fixed geometry mode.
.
.It Cm -x , --borderless
.
Create borderless windows.
.
.It Cm --cache-size Ar size
.
Set imlib2 in-memory cache to
.Ar size
MiB.
A higher cache size can significantly improve performance especially for small
slide shows, however at the cost of increased memory consumption.
.Ar size
must be between 0 and 2048 MiB and defaults to 4.
.
.It Cm -P , --cache-thumbnails
.
Enable thumbnail caching.
Thumbnails are saved in
.Pa $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails ,
which defaults to
.Pa ~/.cache/thumbnails .
Note that thumbnails are only cached if the configured thumbnail size does
not exceed 256x256 pixels.
.
.It Cm -K , --caption-path Ar path
.
Path to directory containing image captions.
This turns on caption viewing, and if captions are found in
.Ar path ,
which is relative to the directory of each image, they are overlayed on the
displayed image.
E.g. with caption path
.Qq captions/ ,
and viewing image
.Qq images/foo.jpg ,
the caption will be looked for in
.Qq images/captions/foo.jpg.txt .
.
.It Cm --conversion-timeout Ar timeout
.
.Nm
can use ImageMagick to try converting unloadable files into a supported
file format.
As this can take a long time, it is disabled by default.
Set
.Ar timeout
to a non-negative value to enable it.
A positive value
specifies after how many seconds conversion attempts should be aborted,
zero causes
.Nm
to try indefinitely.
Negative values restore the default by disabling conversion altogether.
.
.It Cm --class Ar class
.
Set the X11 class hint to
.Ar class .
.
Default: feh
.
.It Cm -L , --customlist Ar format
.
Don't display images, print image info according to
.Ar format
instead.
See
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
.
.It Cm -G , --draw-actions
.
Draw the defined actions and what they do at the top-left of the image.
.
.It Cm --draw-exif
.
.Pq optional feature, $MAN_EXIF$ in this build
display some EXIF information in the bottom left corner, similar to using
.Cm --info
with exiv2 / exifgrep.
.
.It Cm -d , --draw-filename
.
Draw the file name at the top-left of the image.
.
.It Cm --draw-tinted
.
Show overlay texts
.Pq as created by Cm --draw-filename No et al
on a semi-transparent background to improve their readability.
.
.It Cm --edit
.
Enable basic editing of files.
This makes rotation and mirroring
.Pq bound to Qo < Qc , Qo > Qc , Qo | Qc , and Qo _ Qc by default
change the underlying file and not just its displayed content.
.
.It Cm -f , --filelist Ar file
.
This option is similar to the playlists used by music software.
If
.Ar file
exists, it will be read for a list of files to load, in the order they appear.
The format is a list of image file names, absolute or relative to the current
directory, one file name per line.
.
.Pp
.
If
.Ar file
doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal filelist at the end of a
viewing session.
This is best used to store the results of complex sorts
.Pq Cm -Spixels No for example
for later viewing.
.
.Pp
.
Any changes to the internal filelist
.Pq such as deleting a file or it being pruned for being unloadable
will be saved to
.Ar file
when
.Nm
exits.
You can add files to filelists by specifying them on the command line
when also specifying the list.
.
.Pp
.
If
.Ar file
is
.Qq - ,
.Nm
will read the filelist from its standard input.
.
.It Cm -e , --font Ar font
.
Set global font.
Should be a truetype font, resident in the current directory or the font
directory, and should be defined in the form fontname/points, like
.Qq myfont/12 .
.
.It Cm -C , --fontpath Ar path
.
Specify
.Ar path
as extra directory in which to search for fonts; can be used multiple times to
add multiple paths.
.
.It Cm --force-aliasing
.
Disable anti-aliasing for zooming, background setting etc.
.
.It Cm -I , --fullindex
.
Same as index mode, but with additional information below the thumbnails.
Works just like
.Qq feh --index --index-info \&"\&%n\en\&%S\en\&%wx\&%h\&" .
Enables
.Sx MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS .
.
.Pp
.
Note: This option needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of the
.Nm
window, so when using it with many files it will take a while before a
.Nm
window is visible.
Use
.Cm --preload
to get a progress bar.
.
.It Cm -F , --fullscreen
.
Make the window fullscreen.
Note that in this mode, large images will always be scaled down to fit the
screen, and
.Cm --zoom Ar zoom
only affects smaller images and never scales larger than necessary to fit the
screen size.
The only exception is a
.Ar zoom
of 100, in which case images will always be shown at 100% zoom.
.
.Pp
.
When combined with
.Cm --thumbnails ,
this option only affects images opened from the thumbnail overview.
The thumbnail list itself will still be windowed.
.
.It Cm -g , --geometry Ar width Cm x Ar height | Cm + Ar x Cm + Ar y | Ar width Cm x Ar height Cm + Ar x Cm + Ar y
.
Use a fixed window size as specified in the X-style geometry
.Ar string ,
e.g. 640x480.
An optional +x+y window offset can be specified.
Combine with
.Cm --scale-down
to scale down larger images like in fullscreen mode.
.
Note that this option does not enforce the window size; changing it by a tiling
WM or manually is still possible.
However, auto-resize remains disabled.
.
.It Cm -Y , --hide-pointer
.
Hide the pointer
.Pq useful for slideshows .
.
.It Cm -B , --image-bg Ar style
.
Use
.Ar style
as background for transparent image parts and the like.
Accepted values: default, checks, or an XColor
.Pq e.g. Qo black Qc or Qo #428bdd Qc .
Note that some shells treat the hash symbol as a special character, so you
may need to quote or escape it for the XColor code to work.
.
In windowed mode, the default is checks
.Pq a checkered background so transparent image parts are easy to see .
In fullscreen and background setting mode,
.Cm checks
is not accepted and the default is black.
.
.It Cm -i , --index
.
Enable Index mode.
Index mode is similar to montage mode, and accepts the same options.
It creates an index print of thumbnails, printing the image name beneath
each thumbnail.
Index mode enables certain other options, see
.Sx INDEX AND THUMBNAIL MODE OPTIONS
and
.Sx MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS .
.
.It Cm --info Oo Ar flag Oc Ns Ar command_line
.
Execute
.Ar command_line
and display its output in the bottom left corner of the image.
Can be used to display e.g. image dimensions or EXIF information.
Supports
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
.
If
.Ar flag
is set to
.Qo ; Qc ,
the output will not be displayed by default, but has to be enabled by the
toggle_info key.
.
.It Cm --insecure
.
When viewing files with HTTPS, this option disables all certificate checks.
It allows images on sites with self-signed or expired certificates to be
opened, but is no more secure than plain HTTP.
.
.It Cm -k , --keep-http
.
When viewing files using HTTP,
.Nm
normally deletes the local copies after viewing, or, if caching, on exit.
This option permanently stores them on disk, either in the directory
specified by
.Cm --output-dir ,
or in the current working directory.
.
.It Cm --keep-zoom-vp
.
When switching images, keep zoom and viewport settings
.Pq zoom level and X, Y offsets
.
.It Cm -l , --list
.
Don't display images.
Analyze them and display an
.Xr ls 1 - No style
listing.
Useful in scripts to hunt out images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.
.
.It Cm -U , --loadable
.
Don't display images.
Just print out their names if imlib2 can successfully load them.
Returns false if at least one image failed to load.
.
.It Cm --max-dimension Ar width No x Ar height
.
Only show images with width <=
.Ar width
and height <=
.Ar height .
If you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0
.Pq or a negative value .
.
.It Cm -M , --menu-font Ar font
.
Use
.Ar font
.Pq truetype, with size, like Qq yudit/12
as menu font.
.
.It Cm --min-dimension Ar width No x Ar height
.
Only show images with width >=
.Ar width
and height >=
.Ar height .
If you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0.
.
.It Cm -m , --montage
.
Enable montage mode.
Montage mode creates a new image consisting of a grid of thumbnails of the
images in the filelist.
When montage mode is selected, certain other options become available.
See
.Sx MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS .
.
.It Cm -w , --multiwindow
.
Disable slideshow mode.
With this setting, instead of opening multiple files in slideshow mode,
multiple windows will be opened; one per file.
.
.It Cm --no-conversion-cache
.
When loading images via HTTP, ImageMagick or dcraw,
.Nm
will only load/convert them once and re-use the cached file on subsequent
slideshow passes.
This option disables the cache.
It is also disabled when
.Cm --reload
is used.
Use it if you rely on frequently changing files loaded via one of these
sources.
Note that it will impair performance.
.
.It Cm --no-jump-on-resort
.
Don't jump to the first image after resorting the filelist.
.
.It Cm -N , --no-menus
.
Don't load or show any menus.
.
.It Cm --no-screen-clip
.
By default, window sizes are limited to the screen size.
With this option, windows will have the size of the image inside them.
Note that they may become very large this way, making them unmanageable
in certain window managers.
.
.It Cm --no-xinerama
.
.Pq optional feature, $MAN_XINERAMA$ in this build
Disable Xinerama support.
.
.It Cm --on-last-slide Cm hold | Cm quit | Cm resume
.
Select behaviour when trying to select the next image on the last slide
.Pq or the previous image on the first slide
in a slide show.
.
.Pp
.
With
.Cm hold ,
.Nm
will stop advancing images in this case and continue displaying the first/last
image, respectively.
This is intended for linear slide shows.
Behaviour is unspecified when using other navigation commands than previous
and next image.
.
.Pp
.
.Cm quit
will cause
.Nm
to quit when trying to advance past the last image in the slide show.
.
.Pp
.
.Cm resume
is the default behaviour: On the last
.Pq first
image,
.Nm
will wrap around to the first
.Pq last
image.
.
.It Cm -j , --output-dir Ar directory
.
Save files to
.Ar directory
when using
.Cm --keep-http
or the save_image or save_filelist command.
By default, files are saved in the current working directory.
.
.It Cm -p , --preload
.
Preload images.
This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run through them and eliminate
unloadable images first.
Otherwise they will be removed as you flick through.
This also analyses the images to get data for use in sorting, such as pixel
size, type etc.
A preload run will be automatically performed if you specify one of these
sort modes.
.
.It Cm -q , --quiet
.
Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads.
Verbose and quiet modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls
informational messages, the second only errors.
.
.It Cm -z , --randomize
.
When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomize the file list before
displaying.
The list is re-randomized whenever the slideshow cycles (that is, transitions
from last to first image).
.
.It Cm -r , --recursive
.
Recursively expand any directories in the command line arguments
to the content of those directories, all the way down to the bottom level.
.
.It Cm --no-recursive
.
Don't recursively expand any directories.
This is the default, but this option is useful to override themes containing
.Cm --recursive .
.
.It Cm -R , --reload Ar int
.
Reload filelist and current image after
.Ar int
seconds.
Useful for viewing HTTP webcams or frequently changing directories.
.Pq Note that filelist reloading is still experimental.
Set to zero to disable any kind of automatic reloading.
.
.Pp
.
If an image is removed,
.Nm
will either show the next one or quit.
However, if an image still exists, but can no longer be loaded,
.Nm
will continue to try loading it.
.
.Pp
.
Setting this option causes inotify-based auto-reload to be disabled.
Reload is not supported in montage, index, or thumbnail mode.
.
.It Cm -n , --reverse
.
Reverse the sort order.
Use this to invert the order of the filelist.
E.g. to sort in reverse width order, use
.Cm -nSwidth .
.
.It Cm -. , --scale-down
.
Scale images to fit window geometry (defaults to screen size when no geometry
was specified).
Note that the window geometry is not updated when changing images at the moment.
This option is recommended for tiling window managers.
.
This option is ignored when in fullscreen and thumbnail list mode.
.
.Pp
.
In tiling environments, this also causes the image to be centered in the window.
.
.It Cm --scroll-step Ar count
.
Scroll
.Ar count
pixels whenever scroll_up, scroll_down, scroll_left or scroll_right is pressed.
Note that this option accepts negative numbers in case you need to reverse the
scroll direction.
See
.Sx KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX
for how to reverse it permanently.
Default: 20
.
.It Cm -D , --slideshow-delay Ar float
.
For slideshow mode, wait
.Ar float
seconds between automatically changing slides.
Useful for presentations.
Specify a negative number to set the delay
.Pq which will then be Ar float No * (-1) ,
but start
.Nm
in paused mode.
.
.It Cm -S , --sort Ar sort_type
.
Sort file list according to image parameters.
Allowed sort types are:
.Cm name , filename , dirname , mtime , width , height , pixels , size , format .
For sort modes other than
.Cm name , filename , dirname ,
or
.Cm mtime ,
a preload run is
necessary, causing a delay proportional to the number of images in the list.
.
.Pp
.
.Cm mtime
starts with the most recently modified image.
.Cm width , height , pixels
and
.Cm size
start with the smallest.
Use
.Cm --reverse
to sort by oldest or largest first.
.
.Pp
.
For
.Cm name , filename ,
and
.Cm dirname
you can use
.Cm --version-sort
to sort numbers naturally, so that e.g. 10.jpg comes after 2.jpg.
.
.It Cm -| , --start-at Ar filename
.
Start the filelist at
.Ar filename .
If no other files or filelists were specified on the command line,
.Nm
will first load all files from the directory in which
.Ar filename
resides.
This way, it's possible to look at a specific image and use the next / prev
keys to browse through the directory.
See
.Sx USAGE EXAMPLES
for examples.
If
.Ar filename
is a remote URL and no files or filelists were specified,
.Nm
will show
.Ar filename
and not attempt to load additional files or directories.
.
.Pp
.
Note: If you use relative paths in your filelist,
.Ar filename
should also be a relative path.
If you use absolute paths, it should also be an absolute path.
.
If
.Nm
cannot find an exact match, it will compare basenames
.Pq filenames without the directory suffix .
This may lead to mismatches if several files in your filelist
have the same basename.
.
.It Cm -T , --theme Ar theme
.
Load options from config file with name
.Ar theme
- see
.Sx THEMES CONFIG SYNTAX
for more info.
Note that command line options always override theme options.
The theme can also be set via the program name
.Pq e.g. with symlinks ,
so by default
.Nm
will look for a
.Qq Nm
theme.
.
.It Cm -t , --thumbnails
.
Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image launchers.
Note that
.Cm --fullscreen
and
.Cm --scale-down
do not affect the thumbnail window.
They do, however, work for image windows launched from thumbnail mode.
Also supports
.Sx INDEX AND THUMBNAIL MODE OPTIONS
as well as
.Sx MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS .
.
.It Cm -~ , --thumb-title Ar string
.
Set
.Ar title
for windows opened from thumbnail mode.
See also
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
.
.It Cm -^ , --title Ar title
.
Set window title.
Applies to all windows except those opened from thumbnail mode.
See
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
.
.It Cm -u , --unloadable
.
Don't display images.
Just print out their names if imlib2 can NOT successfully load them.
Returns false if at least one image was loadable.
.
.It Cm -V , --verbose
.
output useful information, progress bars, etc.
.
.It Cm -v , --version
.
output version information and exit.
.
.It Cm --version-sort
.
When combined with
.Cm --sort name , --sort filename ,
or
.Cm --sort dirname :
use natural sorting for file and directory names.
In this mode, filenames are sorted as an ordinary human would expect, e.g.
.Qq 2.jpg
comes before
.Qq 10.jpg .
Note that this option only has an effect when a sort mode is set using
.Cm --sort .
.
.It Cm --window-id Ar windowid
.
Draw to an existing X11 window by its ID
.Ar windowid .
This option is intended for use with software such as xcreensaver or
xsecurelock, which provide a window for other applications to draw into.
Unexpected things will happen if you specify a window belonging to software
which does not expect
.Nm
to draw into it or attempt to use options or keybindings which affect window
attributes, such as full-screen mode.
.
.It Cm --xinerama-index Ar screen
.
.Pq optional feature, $MAN_XINERAMA$ in this build
Override
.Nm Ns No 's
idea of the active Xinerama screen.
May be useful in certain circumstances where the window manager places the feh
window on Xinerama screen A while
.Nm
assumes that it will be placed on screen B.
.
.Pp
.
In background setting mode: When used with any option other than
.Cm --bg-tile :
Only set wallpaper on
.Ar screen .
All other screens will be filled black/white.
.
This is most useful in a Xinerama configuration with overlapping screens.
For instance, assume you have two overlapping displays (index 0 and 1),
where index 0 is smaller.
To center a background on the display with index 0 and fill the extra space
on index 1 black/white, use
.Qq --xinerama-index 0
when setting the wallpaper.
.
.It Cm --zoom Ar percent | Cm max | Cm fill
.
Zoom images by
.Ar percent
when in full screen mode or when window geometry is fixed.
When combined with
.Cm --auto-zoom ,
zooming will be limited to the specified
.Ar percent .
Specifying
.Cm max
is like setting
.Cm --auto-zoom ,
using
.Cm fill
makes
.Nm
zoom the image like the
.Cm --bg-fill
mode.
.
.El

.
.Sh MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.
These additional options can be used for index, montage and
.Pq partially
thumbnail mode.
.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.
.It Cm -a , --alpha Ar int
.
When drawing thumbnails onto the background, set their transparency level to
.Ar int
.Pq 0 - 255 .
.
.It Cm -b , --bg Ar file | Cm trans
.
Use
.Ar file
as background for your montage.
With this option specified, the montage size will default to the size of
.Ar file
if no size restrictions were specified.
Alternatively, if
.Ar file
is
.Qq trans ,
the background will be made transparent.
.
.It Cm -X , --ignore-aspect
.
By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect ratios, while
fitting into thumb-width/-height.
This options forces them to be the size set by
.Cm --thumb-width No and Cm --thumb-height .
This will prevent any empty space in the final montage.
.
.It Cm -H , --limit-height Ar pixels
.
Limit the height of the montage.
.
.It Cm -W , --limit-width Ar pixels
.
Limit the width of the montage, defaults to 800 pixels.
.
.Pp
.
If both
.Cm --limit-width No and Cm --limit-height
are specified, the montage will be exactly
.Ar width No x Ar height
pixels in dimensions.
.
.It Cm -o , --output Ar file
.
Save the created montage to
.Ar file .
.
.It Cm -O , --output-only Ar file
.
Just save the created montage to
.Ar file
without displaying it.
.
.It Cm -s , --stretch
.
Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail size, it will
not be enlarged.
If this option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit the thumbnail size.
Aspect ratio will be maintained unless
.Cm --ignore-aspect
is specified.
.
.It Cm -E , --thumb-height Ar pixels
.
Set thumbnail height.
.
.It Cm -y , --thumb-width Ar pixels
.
Set thumbnail width.
.

.
.Sh INDEX AND THUMBNAIL MODE OPTIONS
.
In addition to
.Sx MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.Cm --alpha , --bg , --limit-height , --limit-width , --output , --output-only ,
.Cm --thumb-height , --thumb-width ,
the following options can be used.
.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.
.It Cm --index-info Ar format
.
Show image information based on
.Ar format
below thumbnails in index / thumbnail mode.
See
.Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
May contain newlines.
.
Use
.Qq --index-info ''
to display thumbnails without any info text
.
.Pp
.
Note: If you specify image-related formats
.Pq such as \&%w or \&%s ,
.Nm
needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of its own window.
So when using them with many files, it will take a while before a
.Nm
window becomes visible.
Use
.Cm --preload
to get a progress bar.
.
.It Cm -@ , --title-font Ar font
.
Set font to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, no title will
be printed.
.
.It Cm -J , --thumb-redraw Ar n
.
Redraw thumbnail window every
.Ar n
images while generating thumbnails.
Redrawing takes quite long, so the default is 10.
Set
.Ar n No = 1
to update the thumbnail window immediately.
With
.Ar n No = 0 ,
there will only be one redraw once all thumbnails are loaded.
.
.El
.
.
.Sh BACKGROUND SETTING
.
In many desktop environments,
.Nm
can also be used as a background setter.
Unless you pass the
.Cm --no-fehbg
option, it will write a script to set the current background to
.Pa ~/.fehbg .
So to have your background restored every time you start X, you can add
.Qq ~/.fehbg &
to your X startup script
.Pq such as Pa ~/.xinitrc .
Note that the commandline written to
.Pa ~/.fehbg
always includes the
.Cm --no-fehbg
option to ensure that it is not inadvertently changed by differences in
X11 screen layout or similar.
.
.Pp
.
Note that
.Nm
does not support setting the wallpaper of GNOME shell desktops.
In this environment, you can use
.Qq gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:/// Ns Ar path
instead.
.
.Pp
.
For
.Cm --bg-center , --bg-fill ,
and
.Cm --bg-max ,
you can use
.Cm --geometry
to specify an offset from one side of the screen instead of centering the image.
Positive values will offset from the left/top side, negative values from the
bottom/right.
+0 and -0 are both valid and distinct values.
.
.Pp
.
Note that all options except
.Cm --bg-tile
support Xinerama.
For instance, if you have multiple screens connected and use e.g.
.Cm --bg-center ,
.Nm
will center or appropriately offset the image on each screen.
You may even specify more than one file, in that case, the first file is set
on screen 0, the second on screen 1, and so on.
.
.Pp
.
Use
.Cm --no-xinerama
to treat the whole X display as one screen when setting wallpapers.
You may also use
.Cm --xinerama-index
to use
.Nm
as a background setter for a specific screen.
.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.
.It Cm --bg-center
.
Center the file on the background.
If it is too small, it will be surrounded by a border as specified by
.Cm --image-bg .
.
.It Cm --bg-fill
.
Like
.Cm --bg-scale ,
but preserves aspect ratio by zooming the image until it fits.
Either a horizontal or a vertical part of the image will be cut off
.
.It Cm --bg-max
.
Like
.Cm --bg-fill ,
but scale the image to the maximum size that fits the screen with borders on one side.
The border color can be set using
.Cm --image-bg .
.
.It Cm --bg-scale
.
Fit the file into the background without repeating it, cutting off stuff or
using borders.
But the aspect ratio is not preserved either
.
.It Cm --bg-tile
.
Tile
.Pq repeat
the image in case it is too small for the screen
.
.It Cm --bg-preserve
Combines the results of the addition of the new background with any possibly existing background.
.
.It Cm --no-fehbg
.
Do not write a
.Pa ~/.fehbg
file

.Sh CONFIGURATION
.
.Nm
has three config files:
.Pa themes
for theme definitions,
.Pa keys
for key bindings and
.Pa buttons
for mouse button bindings.
It will try to read them from
.Pa $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feh/ ,
which
.Pq when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset
defaults to
.Pa ~/.config/feh/ .
If the files are not found in that directory, it will also try
.Pa /etc/feh/ .
.Pp
All config files treat lines starting with a
.Qq #
character as comments.
Comments at the end of a line are not supported.
.
.
.Sh THEMES CONFIG SYNTAX
.
.Pa .config/feh/themes
allows the naming of option groups, called themes.
.
.Pp
.
It takes entries of the form
.Qq Ar theme options ... ,
where
.Ar theme
is the name of the entry and
.Ar options
are the options which will be applied when the theme is used.
.
.Pp
.
Note that the option parser does not behave like a normal shell: filename
expansion and backslash escape sequences are not supported and passed to
feh's option parser as-is.
However, quoting of arguments is respected and can be used for arguments
with whitespace.
.
So, the sequence
.Qq --info Qq foo bar
works as intended
.Pq that is, it display the string Qq foo bar ,
whereas the option string
.Qq --info foo\e bar
will only display
.Qq foo\e
and complain about the file bar not existing.
Please keep this in mind when writing theme files.
.
.Pp
.
An example entry is
.Qq imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30 --index-info \&'%n\en\&%wx\&%h\&' .
.
.Pp
.
You can use this theme in two ways.
Either call
.Qo
.Nm
-Timagemap *.jpg
.Qc ,
or create a symbolic link to
.Nm
with the name of the theme you want it to use.
For the example above, this would be
.Qo
ln -s `which
.Nm
` ~/bin/imagemap
.Qc .
Now just run
.Qq imagemap *.jpg
to use these options.
.
.Pp
.
Note that you can split a theme over several lines by placing a backslash at
the end of an unfinished line.
A single option-argument-pair must not span multiple lines.
A single line must not be longer than 1023 characters, but there's no upper
limit for the length of a theme.
.
.Pp
.
Command line options always override theme options.
.
.
.Sh KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX
.
.Pa .config/feh/keys
defines key bindings.
It has entries of the form
.Qq Ar action Op Ar key1 Op Ar key2 Op Ar key3 .
.
.Pp
.
Each
.Ar key
is an X11 keysym name as shown by
.Xr xev 1 ,
like
.Qq Delete .
It may optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which case
.Ar key
looks like
.Ar mod Ns No - Ns Ar keysym
.Po
for example
.Qq C-Delete
for Ctrl+Delete or
.Qq C-1-Delete
for Ctrl+Alt+Delete
.Pc
.
.Pp
.
Available modifiers are
.Ar C No for Control ,
.Ar S No for Shift and
.Ar 1 , 4 No for Mod1 and Mod4 .
To match an uppercase letter like
.Qq S
instead of
.Qq s ,
the Shift modifier is not required.
.
.Pp
.
Specifying an
.Ar action
without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default bindings are removed).
.
.Pp
.
.Em Note:\&
Do not use the same keybinding for multiple actions.
When binding an action to a new key
.Pq or mouse button ,
make sure to unbind it from its previous action, if present.
.Nm
does not check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.
.
.Pp
.
For a list of the
.Ar action
names, see
.Sx KEYS .
Note that not all of the key names used there correspond to X11 keysyms.
Most notably, page up
.Pq Prior / Page_Up ,
page down
.Pq Next / Page_Down
and the keypad keys
.Pq KP_*
do not.
.
.
.Sh KEYS
.
The following actions and default key bindings can be used in an image window.
.Pq The strings in Bo square brackets Bc are the config action names .
.
If
.Nm
is running inside a terminal and its standard input is not used for images or
filelists, key input from the terminal is also accepted.
However, terminal input support is currently limited to most alphanumeric
characters
.Pq 0-9 a-z A-Z and some more ,
arrow keys, return and backspace.
The Alt
.Pq Mod1
modifier is also supported.

Rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts in some image corners when
used with JPEG images.
Rotating in the reverse direction will make them go away.
See

.Sh MOUSE ACTIONS
.
Default Bindings:
When viewing an image, mouse button 1 pans the image
.Pq moves it around
or, when only clicked, moves to the next image
.Pq slideshow mode only .
Quick drags with less than 2px of movement per axis will be treated as clicks
to aid graphics tablet users.
.
Mouse button 2 zooms
.Po click and drag left->right to zoom in, right->left to zoom out, click once
to restore zoom to 100%
.Pc
and mouse button 3 opens the menu.
.
.Pp
.
Ctrl+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image
.Pq drag left to blur, right to sharpen ;
Ctrl+Button 2 rotates the image around the center point.
.
.Pp
.
A note about pan and zoom modes:
In pan mode, if you reach a window border but haven't yet panned to the end of
the image,
.Nm
will warp your cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.
.
.Pp
.
When clicking the zoom button and immediately releasing it, the image will be
back at 100% zoom.
When clicking it and moving the mouse while holding the button down, the zoom
will be continued at the previous zoom level.
The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you entered the zoom mode
remains stationary.
So, to enlarge a specific part of an image, click the zoom button on that part.
.

.
.It feh -r ~/Pictures
.
Recursively show all images found in ~/Pictures and subdirectories
.
.It feh -rSfilename --version-sort ~/Pictures
.
Same as above, but sort naturally.
By default, feh will show files in the string order of their names, meaning e.g.
.Qq foo 10.jpg
will come before
.Qq foo 2.jpg .
In this case, they are instead ordered as a human would expect.
.
.It feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 ~/Pictures
.
Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

.
Show landscape pictures
.Pq image width greater than height
in the current directory.
.
.El
.
.
.Sh DEPENDENCIES
.
When
.Cm --edit
is used,
.Nm
needs the
.Cm jpegtran
and
.Cm jpegexiforient
binaries
.Pq usually distributed in Qo libjpeg-progs Qc or similar
for lossless JPEG rotation.
.
.Pp
.
To view images from URLs such as "http://",
.Nm
must be compiled with libcurl support.
It is $MAN_CURL$ in this build
.
.
.Sh KNOWN BUGS
.
On systems with giflib 5.1.2,
.Nm
may be unable to load gif images.
For affected mips, mipsel and arm devices, gif support is completely
broken, while on x86 / x86_64 gifs can usually only be loaded if they are
the first image in the filelist.
This appears to be a bug in giflib,
see
.Aq https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813729
for details.
Workaround: Use
.Cm --conversion-timeout 5
.Pq or some other positive value
to load gifs with imagemagick instead, or downgrade to giflib 5.1.1, or
upgrade to giflib 5.1.4.

.Pp
.
While loading images using libcurl,
.Nm
will not react to key or mouse actions.
.
.Pp
.
Thumbnail mode is somewhat inefficient, and because of that not nearly as fast
as it could be.
.
.Pp
.
.Cm --scale-down
does not take window decorations into account and may therefore make the
window slightly too large.
