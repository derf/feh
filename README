feh - Imlib2 based image viewer
-------------------------------

 * <http://feh.finalrewind.org/>
 * <http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/>
 * #feh on irc.oftc.net

Dependencies
------------

 * Imlib2
 * libcurl (disable with make curl=0)
 * libpng
 * libX11
 * libXinerama (disable with make xinerama=0)

If built with exif=1:

 * libexif-dev
 * libexif12

Recommended
-----------

 * jpegtran  (supplied by the jpeg library, for lossless image rotation)
 * convert  (supplied by ImageMagick, can be used to load unsupported formats)

Installation
------------

For end users:

$ make
$ sudo make install app=1

For package maintainers and users who do not want feh to install its
icons into /usr/share:

$ make
$ sudo make install

Explanation: feh ships some icons and an X11 desktop entry, which allow it to
be used from file managers, desktop menus and similar. However, installing
icons to /usr/local/share/... does not seem to work reliable in all cases.
Because of this, when using "make install app=1", feh will install its icons
to /usr/share/..., even though they technically belong into /usr/local.

ZSH Completion for feh is available at
<http://git.finalrewind.org/zsh/plain/etc/completions/_feh>

Make flags
----------

Flags can be used to control the build and installation process, e.g. via "make
flag=bool", "make install flag=bool", or "export flag=bool; make && make
install".  For example, "make xinerama=0 debug=1" will disable Xinerama support
and produce a debug build.

Available flags are:

 * app      (default 0) - install icons to /usr/share, regardless of DESTDIR
                          and PREFIX, and call gtk-update-icon-cache afterwards
 * cam      (default 0) - install deprecated feh-cam und gen-cam-menu scripts
 * curl     (default 1) - use libcurl to view http:// and similar images
 * debug    (default 0) - debug build, enables --debug
 * exif     (default 0) - Builtin EXIF tag display support
 * help     (default 0) - include help text (refers to the manpage otherwise)
 * stat64   (default 0) - Support CIFS shares from 64bit hosts on 32bit machines
 * xinerama (default 1) - Support Xinerama/XRandR multiscreen setups

So, by default libcurl and Xinerama are enabled, the rest is disabled.

Additionally, the standard variables PREFIX and DESTDIR are supported.
PREFIX (default /usr) controls where the application and its data files
will be installed. It must be set both during "make" and "make install".
DESTDIR (default empty) sets the installation root during "make install". It
is mostly useful for package maintainers.

Note: config.mk is designed so that in most cases, you can set environment
variables instead of editing it. E.g.:
CFLAGS='-g -Os' make
export DESTDIR=/tmp/feh PREFIX=/usr; make && make install

Builtin EXIF support is maintained by Dennis Real, see
<https://github.com/reald/feh>.


Testing (non-X)
---------------

$ make test

Requires perl >= 5.10 with Test::Command. The tests are non-interactive and
work without X, so they can safely be run even on a headless buildserver.


Testing (X)
-----------

Requires
 * import (usually supplied by imagemagick)
 * perl >= 5.10 with GD, Test::More and X11::GUITest
 * twm
 * Xephyr

$ make test-x11

Be aware that this is quite experimental, so far the X-tests have only been
run on one machine. So they may or may not work for you.

Docker Build
------------

feh includes a Dockerfile which will install all of the dependencies for
compiling feh in a Docker image if desired.

To build feh inside of Docker, you can use the following commands:

$ docker build -t feh .
$ docker run feh

Then feh can be installed on your local system with the usual "sudo make
install".
